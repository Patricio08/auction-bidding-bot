In Portugal, using automation in online auctions is subject to the same general principles as elsewhere, involving the terms of service of the auction platform and local laws. Let’s examine the key factors regarding the legality of using automation in auctions in Portugal:

1. Terms of Service (TOS) of Auction Platforms:
Most international and Portuguese auction platforms (like eBay, Catawiki, or local platforms like Leilões.net) have clear terms that prohibit the use of automated bidding tools or bots.
Violating the platform's terms can result in account suspension, permanent bans, and possibly legal action by the platform. Although such breaches may not directly lead to criminal charges, they could result in civil litigation if the platform claims damages for loss of revenue or harm caused by unfair practices.
2. Portuguese Law on Fraud and Unauthorized Access:
Portuguese law addresses issues that could be relevant to using bots in auctions, particularly in cases where automation provides an unfair advantage or undermines the fairness of the auction process. Specific laws that might apply include:

Fraud (Fraude - Article 217 of the Penal Code): If the use of automation is considered deceptive or manipulative, causing someone to suffer harm or economic loss, it could fall under fraud. While this is more applicable to serious or malicious cases, it can extend to unfair manipulation in commercial activities like auctions.

Computer Crimes (Cybercrime Law - Law 109/2009): Portugal has comprehensive laws governing computer-related crimes. Under the Cybercrime Law, unauthorized access or tampering with computer systems (including auction platforms) could potentially be illegal. If automation is used to bypass security measures (like CAPTCHA), it may be considered unauthorized access or tampering with the platform’s system, which is a criminal offense.

Articles like Article 6 (Unauthorized Access) and Article 7 (Interference with Data) could apply if bots are used to manipulate bidding processes.
Consumer Protection Laws: Portuguese law includes strong consumer protection provisions under the Consumer Protection Act (Lei de Defesa do Consumidor). While it primarily protects consumers from unfair commercial practices, auction platforms could invoke consumer laws if bot use is seen as creating an unfair market environment or damaging fair competition.

3. Auction-Specific Regulations in Portugal:
Portugal has regulations that govern traditional auctions (such as real estate or art), but the legal framework around online auctions is less explicit. However, general consumer protection and cybercrime laws still apply to online auction platforms, meaning that any unfair or deceptive practices — including bot use — could still fall under these general laws.

4. Unfair Commercial Practices:
The Decreto-Lei n.º 57/2008, which implements the EU Directive on unfair commercial practices, could apply in situations where bot use creates an unfair market advantage. The law is aimed at preventing business practices that deceive or exploit consumers.

5. Anti-Bot Sentiment and Potential Legal Expansion:
In the EU, there have been discussions about expanding regulations around bot use, particularly in areas like ticket sales (similar to the BOTS Act in the U.S.). Although no specific anti-bot laws exist yet in Portugal for general online auctions, future laws or regulations could address this.

Summary of Legal Status in Portugal:
Platform Terms of Service:

Most platforms prohibit bots and automation, and violating those terms can result in account suspension or legal action.
Fraud and Unfair Practices:

If automation gives an unfair advantage, it could be classified as fraud or an unfair commercial practice, both of which are prohibited under Portuguese law.
Cybercrime Law:

If bots are used to bypass security measures or manipulate the platform, this could fall under cybercrime laws (specifically unauthorized access).
Ethical and Commercial Risk:

Even if the use of bots doesn’t lead to legal repercussions, it may result in reputation damage or commercial consequences, especially if detected by the platform.
Conclusion:
While no specific laws in Portugal target the use of bots in online auctions, various legal frameworks (fraud, cybercrime, and consumer protection laws) can be applied, especially if the use of automation gives an unfair advantage or involves unauthorized access. The safest course is to respect the terms of service of auction platforms and avoid automation tools that violate these terms.
